# Advent of code 2022

This is my first time doing advent of code and a rust learning exercise!

## How to run

Change the `use` in `main.rs` to the day you want to run and pipe the input files into the program. This is most easily done with

```bash
cargo run < src/dX/input
```

## Debugging in VSCode

There is a config entry for `lldb` called `stdio`. Change this to the
input file to be able to debug.
